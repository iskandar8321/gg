#  Alliance Rules

We are international alliance. We respect all people of any nation.
Any kind of discrimination is not acceptable. 

Our target is to be Number One on this server.

For this we all need to do our best and work hard as a team.

All alliance decisions are made by Lord and Bannerlords.

Official languagues of the alliance wall are: English and Russian. 
All the official announcements will be done in both languages.
For the alliance chat  - we encouradge everyone to write in English, but for now it is not mandatory.
Feel free to speek your own languague, but please respect others and use English as much as you can. 

Speedups in alliance store are forbiden to buy.
They are the prize for top contributors:
1-st place in alliance event - 8 hours,

Other than that rules are very simple:
 - check alliance wall regulary;
