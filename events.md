# Alliance events
It is a team game, so it's very important to contribute as much as you can to teh alliance events.
It's not nessesary to be online 24/7 and spend crystals to do alliance miniimums. 
The key point is to prepare and play smart:)
Here some tips how to be most efficient in th events:
## The Common Good
In this event we need to issue edicts. 
Every 4 hours edicts are updated. You can buy for alliance points "issue new edicts" in alliance store.
If you have statue tell lords day in advance so we can recalculate minimums.
**Tip** update you edicts level to 10 as fast as possible.

## The Time of War 
War event - attack cities and bastions, camps and treasures **do not give points**.
If you participate - put cheap first lvl god troops on the wall.

**DO NOT PUT EPICS**  till other alliances open lvl 2 god they will attack us with efrrets mostly 
and gain more points on us if we use only water.

## Trade Mission 
Very important event. We send ships and gain tablets for god upgrades.
Start prepearing your first ship the day before, so you login in the morning and send it.
Check the wall for the instructions whom to help most. We will help players with subscriptions, statues and highest port level.
This way we can get up to 3 tablets from the ship and max points in the event.
It's very important to help others - you get alliance points and can buy usefull items in alliance store.

## To Arms! 
Simple event you need to recruit as much units as possible.
Till we open water lvl 2 the best units are:
Imp, Nymph and Dream Fairy. They are cheapest and fastest to build and have the best points/minute rate.

After we open water lvl2 - the best units are Kraken and Elementals.
**Tip** start to recruit epic units the day before

## Monster Hunt 
In this event we hunt monsters or synthetyze instruments.
Research your monster lvl to the maximum and hunt as much as you can.
**Tip** do not hunt a day or even 2 before the event to have full energy.

## The Power of the Team 
We gain point for research and build. Research gives 2 times more points so its better to focus on it.
Just plan long running researches to be finished on the event day.

## Blacksmithing
This event is about crafting items.
It often goes with solo shipping event.
The max point you get from wings and rings - start crafting it in advance, and during day help as much as you can in port.

## An Alliance Assignment 
This event is replaced by snowfalls marathon till 14-th of January.
